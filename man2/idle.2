and enters the main scheduling loop.

.BR idle ().
Any user process, even a process with superuser permission,
will receive
.BR EPERM .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR idle ()
never returns for process 0, and always returns \-1 for a user process.
.SH ERRORS

.B EPERM
Always, for a user process.
.SH VERSIONS
Since Linux 2.3.13, this system call does not exist anymore.
.SH STANDARDS

intended to be portable.
