.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: -----------------/
.SS Terms (and abbreviations)
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: string (str) ----/
.TP
.IR "string " ( str )
is a sequence of zero or more non-null characters followed by a null byte.
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: null-padded character seq
.TP
.I character sequence
is a sequence of zero or more non-null characters.
A program should never use a character sequence where a string is required.
However, with appropriate care,
a string can be used in the place of a character sequence.
.RS
.TP
.IR "null-padded character sequence " ( zustr )
Character sequences can be contained in fixed-width buffers,
which contain padding null bytes after the character sequence,
to fill the rest of the buffer
without affecting the character sequence;
however, those padding null bytes are not part of the character sequence.
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: measured character sequence
.TP
.IR "measured character sequence " ( ustr )
Character sequence delimited by its length.
It may be a slice of a larger character sequence,
or even of a string.
.RE
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: length (len) ----/
.TP
.IR "length " ( len )
is the number of non-null characters in a string or character sequence.
It is the return value of
.I strlen(str)
and of
.IR "strnlen(ustr, sz)" .
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: size (sz) -------/
.TP
.IR "size " ( sz )
refers to the entire buffer
where the string or character sequence is contained.
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: end -------------/
.TP
.I end
is the name of a pointer to one past the last element of a buffer.
It is equivalent to
.IR &str[sz] .
It is used as a sentinel value,
to be able to truncate strings or character sequences
instead of overrunning the containing buffer.
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: copy ------------/
.TP
.I copy
This term is used when
the writing starts at the first element pointed to by
.IR dst .
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: catenate --------/
.TP
.I catenate
This term is used when
a function first finds the terminating null byte in
.IR dst ,
and then starts writing at that position.
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Terms (and abbreviations) :: chain -----------/
.TP
.I chain
This term is used when
it's the programmer who provides
a pointer to the terminating null byte in the string
.I dst
(or one after the last character in a character sequence),
and the function starts writing at that location.
The function returns
a pointer to the new location of the terminating null byte
(or one after the last character in a character sequence)
after the call,
so that the programmer can use it to chain such calls.
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Copy, catenate, and chain-copy ---------------/
.SS Copy, catenate, and chain-copy
Originally,
there was a distinction between functions that copy and those that catenate.
However, newer functions that copy while allowing chaining
cover both use cases with a single API.
They are also algorithmically faster,
since they don't need to search for
the terminating null byte of the existing string.
However, functions that catenate have a much simpler use,
so if performance is not important,
it can make sense to use them for improving readability.
.PP
The pointer returned by functions that allow chaining
is a byproduct of the copy operation,
so it has no performance costs.
Functions that return such a pointer,
and thus can be chained,
have names of the form
.RB * stp *(),
since it's common to name the pointer just
.IR p .
.PP
Chain-copying functions that truncate
should accept a pointer to the end of the destination buffer,
and have names of the form
.RB * stpe *().
This allows not having to recalculate the remaining size after each call.
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Truncate or not? -----------------------------/
.SS Truncate or not?
The first thing to note is that programmers should be careful with buffers,
so they always have the correct size,
and truncation is not necessary.
.PP
In most cases,
truncation is not desired,
and it is simpler to just do the copy.
Simpler code is safer code.
Programming against programming mistakes by adding more code
just adds more points where mistakes can be made.
.PP
Nowadays,
compilers can detect most programmer errors with features like
compiler warnings,
static analyzers, and
.BR \%_FORTIFY_SOURCE
(see
.BR ftm (7)).
Keeping the code simple
helps these overflow-detection features be more precise.
.PP
When validating user input,
however,
it makes sense to truncate.
Remember to check the return value of such function calls.
.PP
Functions that truncate:
.IP \(bu 3
.BR stpecpy (3)
is the most efficient string copy function that performs truncation.
It only requires to check for truncation once after all chained calls.
.IP \(bu
.BR strlcpy (3bsd)
and
.BR strlcat (3bsd)
are designed to crash if the input string is invalid
(doesn't contain a terminating null byte).
.IP \(bu
.BR stpncpy (3)
and
.BR strncpy (3)
also truncate, but they don't write strings,
but rather null-padded character sequences.
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Null-padded character sequences --------------/
.SS Null-padded character sequences
For historic reasons,
some standard APIs,
such as
.BR utmpx (5),
use null-padded character sequences in fixed-width buffers.
To interface with them,
specialized functions need to be used.
.PP
To copy strings into them, use
.BR stpncpy (3).
.PP
To copy from an unterminated string within a fixed-width buffer into a string,
ignoring any trailing null bytes in the source fixed-width buffer,
you should use
.BR zustr2stp (3)
or
.BR strncat (3).
.PP
To copy from an unterminated string within a fixed-width buffer
into a character sequence,
ignoring any trailing null bytes in the source fixed-width buffer,
you should use
.BR zustr2ustp (3).
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: Measured character sequences -----------------/
.SS Measured character sequences
The simplest character sequence copying function is
.BR mempcpy (3).
It requires always knowing the length of your character sequences,
for which structures can be used.
It makes the code much faster,
since you always know the length of your character sequences,
and can do the minimal copies and length measurements.
.BR mempcpy (3)
copies character sequences,
so you need to explicitly set the terminating null byte if you need a string.
.PP
However,
for keeping type safety,
it's good to add a wrapper that uses
.I char\~*
instead of
.IR void\~* :
.BR ustpcpy (3).
.PP
In programs that make considerable use of strings or character sequences,
and need the best performance,
using overlapping character sequences can make a big difference.
It allows holding subsequences of a larger character sequence.
while not duplicating memory
nor using time to do a copy.
.PP
However, this is delicate,
since it requires using character sequences.
C library APIs use strings,
so programs that use character sequences
will have to take care of differentiating strings from character sequences.
.PP
To copy a measured character sequence, use
.BR ustpcpy (3).
.PP
To copy a measured character sequence into a string, use
.BR ustr2stp (3).
.PP
Because these functions ask for the length,
and a string is by nature composed of a character sequence of the same length
plus a terminating null byte,
a string is also accepted as input.
.\" ----- DESCRIPTION :: String vs character sequence -----------------/
.SS String vs character sequence
Some functions only operate on strings.
Those require that the input
.I src
is a string,
and guarantee an output string
(even when truncation occurs).
Functions that catenate
also require that
.I dst
holds a string before the call.

.\" ----- CAVEATS :: --------------------------------------------------/
.SH CAVEATS
Don't mix chain calls to truncating and non-truncating functions.
It is conceptually wrong
unless you know that the first part of a copy will always fit.
Anyway, the performance difference will probably be negligible,
so it will probably be more clear if you use consistent semantics:
either truncating or non-truncating.
Calling a non-truncating function after a truncating one is necessarily wrong.
